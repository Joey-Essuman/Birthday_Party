# Birthday_Party
A Git Project On Branching

# STEPS
1. Create 2 branches of **Master** branch with the **git branch new_branch** command
2. Two branches are: **Momma** &  **Whitney** (Example command for creating Momma branch: git branch Momma)
3. The two branches from **Master** were then deleted with **git branch -D branch_name**.
4. A new branch(named unordered-list) containing an unordered list was created to use an unordered list.
5. **git checkout** was used to select that branch.
6. An ordered list was added to the index.html, the change was staged with **git add index.html**, then the change was then commited using **git commit -m "Initial Commit"**
7. After confirming the changes were good, the **unordered-list** branch was merged to **master** using **git merge unordered-list**
8. A second branch called **big-heading** was created to make the heading BIGGER.
9. Changes were made using in-line CSS to make the header bigger.
10. The changes were staged and commited.
11. **git checkout master** was used to select the master branch and **git merge big-heading** was used to merge the branch to the master branch.
12. The final changes were pushed using **git push -u origin master**
13.
